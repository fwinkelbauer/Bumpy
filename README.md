# Bumpy

Bumpy is a tool to manipulate version information across multiple files found in the current working directory using a configuration file which consists of file [search patterns](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8he88b63(v=vs.110).aspx) and regular expressions.

**Note:** As Bumpy's behaviour is heavily influenced by the provided configuration (see below), make sure that your files are kept under version control so that you can easily verify Bumpy's results.

## Why?

Most of the build systems that I have seen in the past create a workflow in which they utilize a single source (e.g. a file called `version.txt`) to inject version information into a set of files (`AssemblyInfo.cs`, `*.csproj`, `*.nuspec`, `*.xml`, `*.yaml`, ...).
This would also mean that some files would contain a "blank version" (such as 0.0.0.0) which would remind developers that they should not touch that file manually. Even though this is a valid solution, it just wasn't for me. That's why Bumpy was born.

## Usage & Examples

Bumpy is a command line tool:

```
bumpy <command> <arguments>
```

Check out the `.bumpyconfig` file [here](https://github.com/fwinkelbauer/Bumpy/blob/master/.bumpyconfig) to see how the following examples were created directly using this repository:

### List

```
bumpy -l
```

Lists all versions.

**Example:** `bumpy -l`

```
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (35): 0.1.0.0
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (36): 0.1.0.0
\NuSpec\Chocolatey\Bumpy.nuspec (5): 0.1.0
```

### Create Configuration

```
bumpy -c
```

Creates an empty `.bumpyconfig` file.

### Increment

```
bumpy -i <one-based index number>
```

Increments the specified component of each version.

**Example:** `bumpy -i 2`

```
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (35): 0.1.0.0 -> 0.2.0.0
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (36): 0.1.0.0 -> 0.2.0.0
\NuSpec\Chocolatey\Bumpy.nuspec (5): 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
```

### Write

```
bumpy -w <version string>
```

Overwrites a version with another version.

This command could be used to e.g:

- Unify the version information of projects and files in a solution
- Change the version information of a newly created project to be in line with other projects in a solution

**Example:** `bumpy -w 1.2.0.5`

```
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (35): 0.2.0.0 -> 1.2.0.5
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (36): 0.2.0.0 -> 1.2.0.5
\NuSpec\Chocolatey\Bumpy.nuspec (5): 0.2.0 -> 1.2.0.5
```

### Assign

```
bumpy -a <one-based index number> <version number>
```

Replaces the specified component of a version with a new number. This command could be used by a CI server to inject a build number.

**Example:** `bumpy -a 3 99`

```
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (35): 1.2.0.5 -> 1.2.99.5
\Source\Bumpy\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs (36): 1.2.0.5 -> 1.2.99.5
\NuSpec\Chocolatey\Bumpy.nuspec (5): 1.2.0.5 -> 1.2.99.5
```

## Configuration

Bumpy's configuration is based on the presence of a `.bumpyconfig` file in the current working directory. This file dictates the behaviour of Bumpy using a pair of file [search patterns](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8he88b63(v=vs.110).aspx) and regular expressions, e.g:

```
# Captures the version tag in all .nuspec files
*.nuspec = <version>(?<version>\d+(\.\d+)+)
```

For each line of a specific file (found through the file search pattern) Bumpy uses the provided regular expression to extract the named regex group `?<version>`.

**Note:** The content of the `?<version>` group has to match the form`\d+(\.\d+)*` (meaning `1`, `1.0`, `1.0.0`, `1.0.0.0` and so on) as this is the only format that is currently supported by Bumpy.

Type `bumpy -c` to create a new configuration file. This file contains additional information about configuration possibilities (e.g. how to change the read/write encoding).

## Trivia

- The name Bumpy is loosely based on the phrase "to bump something up" instead of the original meaning of the word (e.g. "a bumpy road")
